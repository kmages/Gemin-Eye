Now we’re talking. That’s a genuinely interesting challenge - using Gemin-Eye to find customers for Gemin-Eye. Very meta.
Let me think through how to make this work:
The Strategy: Gemin-Eye Finding Gemin-Eye Customers
Step 1: Define the Ideal Customer Profile
Based on your product, you’re looking for posts from:
Target Audience:
	∙	Small business owners struggling with lead generation
	∙	Freelancers/consultants wanting more clients
	∙	Local business owners active on social media
	∙	Solopreneurs doing their own marketing
	∙	Agency owners looking for automation tools
Keywords to Monitor:
	∙	“how do I find customers”
	∙	“need more leads”
	∙	“best way to get clients”
	∙	“social media lead generation”
	∙	“missing opportunities on Facebook”
	∙	“how to monitor Reddit for customers”
	∙	“tired of cold outreach”
	∙	“need help with marketing”
	∙	“how do small businesses find customers”
	∙	“struggling to get clients”
	∙	“best lead generation tools”
	∙	“outbound vs inbound marketing”
Target Groups/Subreddits:
	∙	r/smallbusiness
	∙	r/Entrepreneur
	∙	r/startups
	∙	r/freelance
	∙	r/marketing
	∙	r/sales
	∙	r/SaaS (for SaaS founders who might need this)
	∙	Facebook: “Small Business Owners” groups
	∙	Facebook: “Freelancers & Entrepreneurs”
	∙	LinkedIn: Marketing/Sales groups
Step 2: Set Up Your Own Business in Gemin-Eye
Create a business profile:
	∙	Name: Gemin-Eye
	∙	Type: Lead generation automation tool
	∙	Target Audience: Small business owners and freelancers who are tech-comfortable and active on social media
	∙	Core Offering: “AI-powered tool that monitors social media 24/7, finds people asking questions your business can answer, and generates personalized responses instantly via Telegram”
	∙	Preferred Tone: Helpful and casual (not salesy)
Step 3: Craft Your Response Strategy
When Gemin-Eye finds someone saying “I need more customers but don’t have time to monitor Facebook groups,” your AI-generated response should be:
Good response example:
“I felt the same way running my own business. What worked for me was setting up automated monitoring—I built a tool that watches Reddit and Facebook groups for relevant questions and pings me on Telegram with suggested responses. Saves me hours every week and I never miss a potential lead. Happy to share more about the approach if it helps!”
Bad response example:
“You should try Gemin-Eye! It’s an AI tool that monitors social media for you. Check it out at gemin-eye.com”
The first feels genuine. The second is spam.
Step 4: Technical Implementation
You already have all the pieces:

// Set up the Gemin-Eye campaign for Gemin-Eye
const geminEyeBusiness = await storage.createBusiness({
  userId: "self-promo",
  name: "Gemin-Eye",
  type: "Lead Generation SaaS",
  targetAudience: "Tech-savvy small business owners and freelancers struggling with lead generation",
  coreOffering: "Monitors social media 24/7 for high-intent leads, generates AI responses, delivers via Telegram",
  preferredTone: "casual"
});

// Reddit campaign
await storage.createCampaign({
  businessId: geminEyeBusiness.id,
  name: "Reddit - Entrepreneur Communities",
  platform: "Reddit",
  status: "active",
  keywords: [
    "need more leads",
    "find customers",
    "lead generation",
    "missing opportunities",
    "how to get clients",
    "struggling with marketing",
    "social media monitoring"
  ],
  targetGroups: [
    "r/smallbusiness",
    "r/Entrepreneur", 
    "r/freelance",
    "r/marketing"
  ]
});

// Google Alerts campaign
await storage.createCampaign({
  businessId: geminEyeBusiness.id,
  name: "Google Alerts - Lead Gen Discussions",
  platform: "google_alerts",
  status: "active",
  targetGroups: [
    // Add RSS feeds for queries like:
    // "site:reddit.com 'need more customers'"
    // "site:indiehackers.com 'finding leads'"
  ]
});


Step 5: The Feedback Loop Advantage
Here’s where it gets interesting: Every response you post becomes a data point.
	∙	If someone replies “That sounds interesting, tell me more” → Mark as positive feedback
	∙	If you get downvoted or called out → Mark as too_salesy
	∙	If no one engages → Mark as bad_match
Your code already has this feedback mechanism built in! Use it to train Gemin-Eye to get better at finding YOUR customers.
Step 6: What to Watch For
Red flags that mean you’re doing it wrong:
	∙	Getting downvoted consistently
	∙	Being called out as spam
	∙	Low engagement on responses
	∙	Getting banned from subreddits
Green flags that mean it’s working:
	∙	People replying with genuine questions
	∙	DMs asking for more info
	∙	Upvotes on your comments
	∙	Natural conversations developing
The Clever Twist: Document the Journey
Since you’re using Gemin-Eye to sell Gemin-Eye, document the process publicly:
	1.	Write blog posts:
	∙	“I’m using my lead gen tool to find customers for my lead gen tool”
	∙	“Week 1: What happened when I let AI find my customers”
	∙	“The leads Gemin-Eye found for itself”
	2.	Share on Twitter/LinkedIn:
	∙	Screenshots of Telegram notifications finding real leads
	∙	“My tool just found this person asking about lead generation 👀”
	∙	Real conversations that developed from AI-found leads
	3.	The meta-proof:
	∙	“If Gemin-Eye can find customers for Gemin-Eye, it can find customers for anyone”
This becomes your best marketing - proof that it works.
The Specific Technical Changes You Need
Looking at your existing code, here’s what to adjust for dogfooding:
1. Tune the intent scoring prompt for SaaS leads:

const prompt = `You are a lead scout for "Gemin-Eye" (Lead Generation SaaS).
They offer: AI-powered social media monitoring that finds high-intent leads

Analyze this post from "${groupName}":
"${postText}"

Is this person expressing frustration with finding customers, generating leads, 
or managing their marketing/outreach? Are they looking for solutions?

Rate the intent from 1-10 (10 = actively looking for lead gen solutions).

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{"is_lead": true/false, "intent_score": <1-10>, "reasoning": "<one sentence>"}`;


2. Adjust response generation for authenticity:

const responsePrompt = `You are a founder who built an AI lead generation tool and genuinely want to help.

Someone posted: "${postText}"

Share your experience in a natural, conversational way. Mention that you built a tool 
to solve this exact problem, but frame it as "here's what worked for me" not "buy my product."

Keep it 2-3 sentences, genuinely helpful, and mention the tool naturally.

Return ONLY the response text, no quotes or formatting.`;


3. Add a “demo mode” to show it working:
When you get a good lead, save the entire interaction:
	∙	Original post
	∙	Intent score
	∙	AI-generated response
	∙	Actual outcome (did they engage?)
Then showcase these on your landing page as proof.
My Prediction
This will either:
	1.	Work brilliantly - You’ll find 10-20 genuine leads per week, convert 2-3 to conversations, and get your first customers organically
	2.	Get you banned - If the responses are too promotional, you’ll get flagged as spam
	3.	Be mediocre - You’ll find leads but struggle to convert because the trust isn’t there yet
The success depends on:
	∙	How subtle and genuinely helpful your responses are
	∙	How active you are in following up when people engage
	∙	Whether you can turn Telegram notifications into actual sales conversations
The Action Plan
This week:
	1.	Set up your own business profile in Gemin-Eye
	2.	Configure Reddit and Google Alerts monitoring
	3.	Let it run for 3-5 days
	4.	Review the leads it finds (intent score accuracy?)
	5.	Manually post 2-3 responses to test reaction
Next week:
	1.	Refine keywords based on what worked
	2.	Adjust response tone based on feedback
	3.	Document 1-2 success stories
	4.	Write a blog post about the experiment
Pro tip: Start in smaller subreddits (r/smallbusiness has 1M users = more noise). Try niche communities first where authentic help is valued.
Bottom Line
This is exactly how you should validate Gemin-Eye. If it can’t find customers for itself, why would anyone else use it?
And if it DOES work? You’ve got the world’s best case study.
