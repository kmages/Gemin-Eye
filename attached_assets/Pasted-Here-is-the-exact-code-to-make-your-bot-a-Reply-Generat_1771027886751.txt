Here is the exact code to make your bot a "Reply Generator."

This version waits for YOU to find a post on Facebook or Reddit. When you copy/paste that post into Telegram, the bot instantly checks your client list (Tony's, Doro, etc.), picks the right one, and writes the perfect reply for you to copy back.

The "Compliant Spy" Code
1. Delete everything in your Replit index.js.
2. Paste this code.
3. Hit "Run".

JavaScript
/* 👁️ GEMIN-EYE: THE COMPLIANT SPY (Manual Mode) */
const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require("@google/generative-ai");
const TelegramBot = require("node-telegram-bot-api");

// --- YOUR KEYS ---
const BOT_TOKEN = "8293816436:AAHglCt5ODKrLUTlyMuwPqM1Pyjjzmkd_DM";
const GEMINI_KEY = "AIzaSyC3SMCGRSM69NI2GUUBCMeK7iLiMEBx6Ww";

// --- THE CLIENT DOSSIER (The Brain) ---
const CLIENTS = `
1. TONY'S (Keywords: food, pizza, dinner, hungry, Brookfield, La Grange)
   - Voice: Friendly local, family-oriented.
   - Offer: "Best thin crust in the burbs. Come by for a slice!"

2. DORO MIND (Keywords: anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia, mental health, therapy, support)
   - Voice: Empathetic, professional, supportive, soft.
   - Offer: "We have a VR tool that helps manage triggers safely."

3. LMAITFY.ai (Keywords: AI tool, ChatGPT, productivity, tech help, automation)
   - Voice: Sarcastic tech expert, helpful but snarky.
   - Offer: "Stop Googling, let me AI that for you."
`;

// Initialize
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(GEMINI_KEY);
const bot = new TelegramBot(BOT_TOKEN, { polling: true }); 

console.log("👁️ Gemin-Eye is online. Send me a post to analyze!");

// --- THE LISTENER ---
bot.on('message', async (msg) => {
  const chatId = msg.chat.id;
  const incomingText = msg.text;

  // Ignore short messages like "hi"
  if (!incomingText || incomingText.length < 5) return;

  console.log(`📥 Analyzing: "${incomingText.substring(0, 20)}..."`);
  
  try {
    // 1. Send "Thinking..." status
    await bot.sendChatAction(chatId, 'typing');

    // 2. Ask Gemini to write the reply
    const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-1.5-flash" });
    
    const prompt = `
    You are a strategic marketing expert. Here are my clients:
    ${CLIENTS}

    I just found this post on social media: 
    "${incomingText}"

    TASK:
    1. Identify which client this post is a lead for. (If none, say "NO MATCH").
    2. Write a short, natural reply I can copy/paste back to the group.
    
    FORMAT:
    🎯 **Client:** [Name]
    📝 **Draft Reply:** [The Reply]
    `;

    const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
    const response = result.response.text();

    // 3. Send the draft back to you
    await bot.sendMessage(chatId, response, { parse_mode: 'Markdown' });

  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ Error:", error.message);
    bot.sendMessage(chatId, "❌ Brain freeze. Try again.");
  }
});
How to Test It Immediately:
Once you hit Run and see "Gemin-Eye is online" in the console:

Open Telegram.

Paste this (pretend you found it on Facebook):

"Does anyone know a good pizza place near Brookfield? I'm starving."

Watch the Bot. It should reply with a pitch for Tony's.

Then paste this:

"My son was just diagnosed with schizophrenia and I'm overwhelmed."
It should switch to Doro Mind mode.

You are now the Eyes. The Bot is the Voice.
