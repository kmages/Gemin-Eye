Got it. Let me give you my honest technical opinion of Gemin-Eye as a product and codebase.
My Honest Take on Gemin-Eye
The Core Concept: Genuinely Clever
The fundamental insight is solid: there are countless high-intent leads hiding in plain sight on social media, and most businesses completely miss them because manual monitoring doesn’t scale. Using AI to filter and respond is the right approach.
What makes it smart:
	∙	You’re not trying to automate spam - you’re automating helpful engagement
	∙	The intent scoring (1-10) is practical and actionable
	∙	Telegram delivery is perfect for this use case (instant, mobile-friendly, copy-paste ready)
	∙	The bookmarklet approach for Facebook/LinkedIn is creative problem-solving
The Code Quality: Solid B+
Strengths:
	1.	Clean architecture - Clear separation of concerns with client/server/shared
	2.	Modern stack - TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, React - you made good technology choices
	3.	Type safety - Proper use of TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation
	4.	Database design - The schema is well-normalized with proper relations
	5.	Real functionality - This isn’t vaporware; the code actually works
Weaknesses (from my earlier review):
	1.	N+1 queries - Storage layer does sequential database calls instead of batch operations
	2.	In-memory state - Rate limiting and wizard state lost on restart
	3.	Error handling - Too generic, makes debugging harder
	4.	telegram-bot.ts - 1422 lines doing too much, needs refactoring
	5.	No timeout/retry logic - AI API calls could hang indefinitely
	6.	AI response parsing - Fragile regex-based JSON extraction
These aren’t dealbreakers - they’re technical debt you can pay down later. The code works, which is what matters for an MVP.
The Product Execution: Interesting Hybrid
You’ve created something that’s neither fully automated nor fully manual - it’s assisted:
Automated pieces (good):
	∙	Reddit monitoring
	∙	Google Alerts integration
	∙	Intent scoring
	∙	Response generation
Manual pieces (smart):
	∙	Bookmarklets for Facebook/LinkedIn (because APIs are restricted)
	∙	Human approval before posting (builds trust, avoids AI mistakes)
	∙	Feedback loop (improves responses over time)
This hybrid approach is actually more realistic than fully-automated solutions that promise magic. You’re being honest about what’s possible.
The Business Model: Has Potential But…
Who is this for?
	∙	Small business owners who are active on social media
	∙	Consultants/freelancers building personal brands
	∙	Local businesses (restaurants, gyms, services)
The value proposition is clear:
	∙	Save time monitoring
	∙	Never miss a lead
	∙	Get better at engagement
But here are the challenges:
	1.	The learning curve - Setting up Telegram bots and bookmarklets isn’t trivial for non-technical users
	2.	The trust barrier - Businesses need to trust your AI won’t embarrass them with bad responses
	3.	The platform risk - Facebook/LinkedIn could shut down bookmarklet approaches at any time
	4.	The ROI question - Users need to convert leads to revenue quickly or they’ll churn
	5.	The scaling problem - Each business needs custom keywords/groups/tone - this doesn’t scale without doing the setup work
What I Really Think
This is a working MVP that solves a real problem. That puts you ahead of 90% of side projects.
The code isn’t perfect, but it’s good enough - which is exactly where an MVP should be. You haven’t over-engineered it, you haven’t under-built it. You’ve shipped something functional.
The clever parts:
	∙	Using Gemini instead of OpenAI (cheaper, good enough)
	∙	Telegram for delivery (simple, mobile-first)
	∙	Intent scoring to reduce noise
	∙	Feedback loop for improvement
	∙	Bookmarklets as a workaround for API restrictions
The realistic parts:
	∙	You keep humans in the loop (approval before posting)
	∙	You acknowledge platform limitations (manual scanning needed)
	∙	You focus on specific use cases (not trying to boil the ocean)
The honest assessment:
This is a boutique tool for technical-adjacent small business owners - not a mass-market SaaS. And that’s fine. It could make $5-10K MRR with 50-100 customers at $99-199/mo if you nail the positioning.
The Hard Questions
Is this a venture-scale business?
No. Too niche, too much manual setup, platform risks.
Is this a profitable lifestyle business?
Maybe. Depends on customer acquisition cost vs. lifetime value.
Is this a good portfolio piece?
Absolutely. Shows you can build end-to-end products with modern AI.
Would I use it?
If I ran a local business or consultancy and was comfortable with tech, yes. For $100/mo to save 10 hours of monitoring? That’s a no-brainer.
If I Were Your Technical Advisor
Short term (pre-launch):
	1.	Fix the N+1 queries (performance issue)
	2.	Add proper error logging (you’ll need it)
	3.	Write a 1-page setup guide for non-technical users
	4.	Add a “test mode” to demo the product without Telegram setup
Medium term (first 10 customers):
	1.	Add analytics dashboard (show ROI)
	2.	Build template library (common business types)
	3.	Add response A/B testing
	4.	Improve the feedback loop with specific adjustments
Long term (if scaling):
	1.	Native mobile app (better than Telegram bot)
	2.	Chrome extension (better than bookmarklets)
	3.	Zapier integration (expand beyond social media)
	4.	White-label option (sell to agencies)
The Real Talk
You asked for my opinion without the GitHub marketing advice. Here it is:
The product is solid. It works, it solves a problem, the code is clean enough. You didn’t over-build it or under-build it.
The code has technical debt but nothing catastrophic. You can refactor as you grow.
The business model is viable but niche. This won’t be a unicorn, but it could be a nice income stream.
The execution shows good judgment - you made pragmatic choices and shipped. That matters more than perfect code.
If you’re building this as:
	∙	A business → Keep iterating based on user feedback
	∙	A portfolio piece → It’s already impressive
	∙	A learning project → You’ve learned a ton
	∙	Something to sell → Package it better but the bones are good
My one piece of advice: Get 10 paying users ASAP. Their feedback will matter infinitely more than my code review. The code works - now validate whether people will actually pay for it.
That’s my honest take. What are you actually planning to do with it?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
