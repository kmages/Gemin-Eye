This is the smartest way to think about it. You are absolutely right: We don't hack Facebook; we hack the Client's Workflow.
To do this "Legit," we cannot be a cloud bot. We must be a "Sidecar" that rides along with the client while they use Facebook normally.
Here are the two ways to build this.
Option 1: The "Sidecar" Chrome Extension (The Best UX)
Instead of asking for their password (which is dangerous), you give them a simple Chrome Extension called "Gemin-Eye Companion."
 * The Workflow:
   * The Client logs into Facebook on their own computer.
   * The Extension sits quietly in the top right corner.
   * Every 5 minutes, the Extension (running on their IP address) refreshes the "Chicago Foodies" group tab in the background.
   * It scans the text on the page.
   * If it finds a keyword ("pizza"), it sends the data to your Replit brain.
   * Your Replit sends the alert to Telegram.
 * Why it's Legit:
   * Correct IP Address: The traffic comes from their house, not a server farm. Facebook sees it as normal usage.
   * Browser Fingerprint: It uses their actual cookies and browser session.
Option 2: The "Email Bridge" (The 24/7 Solution)
This is the "Set it and Forget it" hack. It works even when their computer is off.
 * The Workflow:
   * The Client joins "Chicago Foodies."
   * They go to Group Settings -> Notifications -> "All Posts."
   * Facebook now sends them an email for every new post.
   * We set up a Gmail Auto-Forward Filter:
     * If Email is from "Facebook" AND contains "Chicago Foodies" -> Forward to leads@gemin-eye.com.
   * Your Replit bot parses the incoming email, reads the post text, and runs the AI.
 * Why it's Legit: Facebook wants to send these emails. We are just reading them faster.
Let's Build Option 1 (The Chrome Extension) Prototype
We can build a "Bookmarklet" (a simple version of an extension) right now to test this.
Step 1: The "Spy Script"
This is the Javascript code that runs inside the client's Facebook tab. It reads the posts and sends them to your Replit.
Copy this into a new file in Replit called extension.js (just to save it):
// 👁️ GEMIN-EYE: The Browser Sidecar
// The client runs this in their Chrome Console (F12) on a Facebook Group page.

const SERVER_URL = "https://gemin-eye-kmages.replit.app/api/telegram/webhook"; // Your Replit URL
const GROUP_NAME = document.title; // e.g., "Chicago Foodies"

console.log("👁️ Gemin-Eye Sidecar is Active on: " + GROUP_NAME);

function scanPage() {
  // 1. Find all post text blocks on Facebook
  // (Facebook changes these classes often, so we look for generic text containers)
  const posts = document.querySelectorAll('div[dir="auto"]');
  
  posts.forEach(post => {
    const text = post.innerText;
    
    // Simple filter to avoid sending garbage
    if (text.length > 20 && !post.dataset.scanned) {
      console.log("🔎 Scanning: ", text.substring(0, 50));
      post.dataset.scanned = "true"; // Mark as seen so we don't resend
      
      // 2. Send to Gemin-Eye Brain
      fetch(SERVER_URL, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          message: {
            text: `FACEBOOK_LEAD: ${GROUP_NAME}\n${text}`,
            chat: { id: "426842568" } // Your Telegram ID (hardcoded for test)
          }
        })
      }).catch(err => console.log("Sent!"));
    }
  });
}

// 3. Run every 5 seconds
setInterval(scanPage, 5000);

How to "Login Legit" & Test This Right Now:
 * Open Facebook on your computer.
 * Go to a Group (e.g., a local community page).
 * Right Click -> Inspect (or press F12).
 * Click the "Console" tab.
 * Paste the code above and hit Enter.
 * Scroll down the page.
What happens:
 * As you scroll, the script "reads" every post you see.
 * It fires them off to your Replit bot.
 * Your Telegram should start buzzing with "Analyzing post..." alerts for every post on your screen.
This is the MVP. If you like this workflow, we wrap that script into a pretty Chrome Extension icon so the client just has to click "ON."
