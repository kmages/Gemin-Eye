You
What does your ChatGPT research tell you? 

Alan Morgan
I just got, got home. I mean, I, the chat, TV thing as far as the pricing. 

You
So you didn't even have a chance to really read what you sent me. 

Alan Morgan
Well, I mean, I, I watched the road. It says, hey, this, this is the cream of. Of advertising and it's a uh, you know, a 75 to $300 per 

You
Yep. 

Alan Morgan
league. Or, you know, I want some, you know, hey, but it's, it's a. You know, a quality thing, you know, and it didn't, didn't say anything about, you know, I didn't ask you to follow up on the follow-up questions. Well, you know, what's the comparison with, you know, Google ads and, you know, I mean, how do you find customers and, you know, all the rest of those things like that. But, you know, it obviously has immense value, if it. Can be marketed. To the appropriate. Client. I mean, if, you know, I mean, if, if you are, I mean, you know, let's just take Mike for a second, if Mike is looking to increase, is, you know, traffic. You know, I mean, and he was going to pay uh, you know, uh, X number of dollars, you know, you have to make the assumption they're willing to pay. Uh, you know, I mean, that's the, that's one of the problems. I mean, what it's worth is, it's only worth it. If the client or customer is willing to pay for Google and words or Facebook and words or whatever they're willing to pay. You know, you got all these people that want it. But, you know, it's only a question of who's willing to pay the. You know, if they had an ad budget. Sure, you know, it's fine. And then, then it's a great business to be in. 

You
So. 

Alan Morgan
I mean, but you got to find a customer that's willing to pay. Per league. You know. Uh, you know, uh, which is obviously the best way of doing it because it's, you know, 

You
So 

Alan Morgan
I, yeah. 

You
you didn't watch the Super Bowl. I'm pretty sure. 

Alan Morgan
I watched a little bit of it, but you know. 

You
Pretty bad game. Um, 

Alan Morgan
I know. 

You
but Claude, the parent company being anthropic, ran adds making fun of open AI, who has started inserting ads into their free tear of search. 

Alan Morgan
Okay, well, they're trying to monetize it. You know, right? Finally, they're working for an income stream. Yeah, okay. 

You
Now, that goes in the face of the founder speaking three or four years ago at a VC conference saying that if open AI ever put ads in their search, somebody should take a shovel and bury him. 

Alan Morgan
Well, time change, man. Oh, come on. 

You
Right, I don't hold that against him. I'm just saying that the folks at anthropic took great fun at leveraging that inconsistency, I won't even call it hypocrisy. 

Alan Morgan
They're, they're, they're, they're wagging their, you know, thumbs or whatever it is, you know, you know, hey, of course they would. you know, I mean, hey, it's, it's like, you know, hey, you promised never to raise 

You
Right. 

Alan Morgan
taxes and here you're writing taxes. Okay. You promise they have us to lower inflation is double. You, you know, hey, I mean, of course you're, you know, whatever you promise that you don't deliver. Hey, you know, people, you know, hey, you know, hey, it makes great. Great political or 

You
So, 

Alan Morgan
advertising, you know? 

You
anthropics point. In the ads they ran in the Super Bowl was, our AI agent is so good, people are paying us to use it. We don't need to run ads. Yours is obviously not so good. 

Alan Morgan
And 3 and and 2 years from now when they start running ads. 

You
Well, okay, 

Alan Morgan
Yeah 

You
let's separate those two subjects for a second. So there's the topic of inserting ads into search, which Google has been doing since day one. They've never hidden their agenda. Google, if you were to ask the CEO of Google, what are you? He would say, we're an advertising company. 

Alan Morgan
Well, I'm studying amongst other things, that wouldn't surprise 

You
But 

Alan Morgan
me, you know. 

You
he would say it with pride, not 

Alan Morgan
Oh 

You
shame, 

Alan Morgan
okay. 

You
that was their 

Alan Morgan
Oh. 

You
mission from day one was to, 

Alan Morgan
Build an advertising platform, 

You
well, 

Alan Morgan
you 

You
to 

Alan Morgan
know. 

You
marry an inquiry with a good answer. And so if 

Alan Morgan
Yeah. 

You
the inquiry was, where do I get the lowest priced pots and pans, then they should have an advertiser that's ready to fill the void with that answer. Right? 

Alan Morgan
Well, yeah. 

You
But 

Alan Morgan
Well. 

You
what happened to Google, was they became so successful at what they set out to do, that the only way they could regulate the fairness of their platform in terms of an anti monopoly sort of thing, was to make every keyword that they offer an auctionable word. So, if the word is Las Vegas, who's willing to pay the most in an open blind auction for that keyword, and then you will be listed first when somebody says, What's the nicest hotel in Las Vegas? 

Alan Morgan
Yeah, I mean, it's it's a, it's a defense to 

You
Right, antitrust, 

Alan Morgan
anti-monopoly. 

You
you know. 

Alan Morgan
As well as being the highest revenue 

You
So, 

Alan Morgan
generator. 

You
yeah, 

Alan Morgan
I mean, you know, it's a combination too. 

You
but 

Alan Morgan
You 

You
the 

Alan Morgan
know. 

You
flip side is... 

Alan Morgan
They wouldn't do it. It reduced the revenue dramatically. 

You
The flip side is, people no longer trust a Google answer as much as they trust an open AI answer, because rightly or wrongly, they feel that a Google answer is tainted by who bought the answer. Who 

Alan Morgan
Hey. 

You
paid for the answer? Whereas 

Alan Morgan
Yeah, okay. I mean, 

You
Gemini, 

Alan Morgan
right. 

You
which is also part of Google, right, people can look at that and say, well, that's in a separate bucket, because that's their AI, that's not their, 

Alan Morgan
That's 

You
it's 

Alan Morgan
that's a day, a 

You
not their 

Alan Morgan
day. 

You
ad platform. 

Alan Morgan
Been tainted as of yet. 

You
In fact, they are one and the same, right? So let's just be clear. So, 

Alan Morgan
You know? 

You
what I'm suggesting is that we aggregate all the platforms and say, We're just looking for the customer that's looking for the answer and the answer is going to come with a link to the solution to the thing that they're looking for. And we don't care if they're on Facebook. We don't care if they're on LinkedIn. We don't care if they're on Reddit. We don't care where they are. Now, we'll never see. I shouldn't say never. That's not a good word. It's not likely, we'll see where people are searching Google, because Google is not a social network. YouTube is a social network. Google search is not a social network. So 

Alan Morgan
All right. 

You
their business is not threatened by what I'm proposing in any way, really. 

Alan Morgan
No, but. But the issue is. You don't want to. You don't want to say that. I mean, you know, hey, in theory, what you're saying is correct. In practice, you, you have to, starting small, you have to, not, poke the bears, and you have, or, or give them the opportunity to kill you by not using AI in the, name and the process, and not using, we've searched, you know, all the social media to help you get bad. You try and avoid all 

You
Well, 

Alan Morgan
that. 

You
think about Facebook for a second. They 

Alan Morgan
Yeah. 

You
also have a very formidable AI engine. It's not very popular, but it's powerful. So why couldn't they just do what I'm suggesting and say, whenever somebody posts something on their platform, they respond with a personalized user friendly recommendation, which is really nothing more than a paid ad. Right. 

Alan Morgan
Well, I can't. 

You
I don't see why they couldn't. 

Alan Morgan
They can't. They, but, It may not, again, it may not fit with what they're trying. I mean, you know, their current, revenue streams, and, you know, and they are a big company, and they don't 

You
Well, 

Alan Morgan
pimping at a time. 

You
that's, you really just hit the nail on the head, because that's what I was going to say, because their ad model today is you buy a billboard to put in front of a group of people that fit the criteria of what you are looking for. It's the opposite of what I'm suggesting. For 

Alan Morgan
Right, 

You
them 

Alan Morgan
I mean. 

You
to pivot their platform, to be more of a customized tailored response mechanism would do two things, I think. It would alienate the people that use the service, my opinion. And it would cause them to have to rethink the entire way that Facebook ads work. 

Alan Morgan
And and yeah, you know, revenue streams. I mean, yeah, I mean, because what, what you're proposing is the difference between. Yeah, an audience filled with people. Oh, are. You know, hey, I mean, yeah. You know, uh, Rod Stewart fans and a catcher. Okay? And I mean, they, you know they're all interested in Rod Stewart, because they're at the concert. The difference is that, the ones that are, Texting him, at that moment, saying, please play this song, are the ones that are most. Uh, you know, most, most active and have the highest chance of. you know, 

You
Well, 

Alan Morgan
success. 

You
it's definitely food for thought. We. 

Alan Morgan
No way, I mean, I think it is definitely, a, a, for a least 

You
. 

Alan Morgan
a short period of time. A potential marketing tool until somebody else figures it out, tries it, doesn't. I mean, there's a 1st over advantage or whatever, but the issue is you have to find the customers that are willing to pay. For the lead, you know? 

You
Yeah, that's a whole nother aspect 

Alan Morgan
Well, no, 

You
of 

Alan Morgan
that's. 

You
what I did that I haven't really thought through because my original thinking was literally, okay, here's the genesis of my idea. I built the, let me AI that for you, silly page. . And then I thought, I have a zero budget. How do I promote it? So that started my wheels turning, right? 

Alan Morgan
Right. 

You
And then I started thinking about my paid job, the doro mind job, and thinking, I'm being paid to try and find two things for doro mind patients, or caregivers, who have patients that they take care of. And doctors who might want to join the network, the Doro Mine Network, right? So, 

Alan Morgan
Yeah, it's totally. Yeah. 

You
you know, my boss is very... I'm trying to think of the right word. I want to say aggressive, but that's not really the right word. She's very passionate, 

Alan Morgan
Passionate. 

You
is a good word, about getting people into our network because it's morally the right thing to do, and it generates revenue for our business. And I really believe that's the order in which she sees things. Okay? 

Alan Morgan
Okay. 

You
So... 

Alan Morgan
That's, that's fine. Yeah 

You
So I'm thinking about those two things, right? And I'm on with the agency that I picked to do our Google Ad Word presentation. I could do it myself, but that would be a full time job for me, and there are people that do that way better than I can do it at any 

Alan Morgan
Oh, and. 

You
price. 

Alan Morgan
And it's not cost. I mean you need, there's no value to you. You're not getting the 10 grand 

You
Well, 

Alan Morgan
a month. 

You
yeah, there's no right. There's no value to me personally, that's for sure, but I was... Right. 

Alan Morgan
Well, that's what I'm saying, 

You
But thinking 

Alan Morgan
so. 

You
about how easily Google was willing to do that for a not for profit company wasn't that hard, really. And because what do they have to lose? They give you $120,000 worth of advertising. They take it out of their left pocket. I go to the agency, and the agency puts it in Google's right pocket. 

Alan Morgan
I mean, yeah, it's not, you know, hey, and there's all kinds of PR 

You
Right, 

Alan Morgan
benefits 

You
so they get a lot of corporate 

Alan Morgan
and. 

You
goodwill from doing it anyway. Yeah. 

Alan Morgan
guys, right? We're not 

You
Yeah, 

Alan Morgan
anti- and we're 

You
look at 

Alan Morgan
not. 

You
all the things we do to help the world. Right. 

Alan Morgan
Help the nonprofit world, yeah. 

You
Okay, so, that's, but because I was in those dialogues, and because I was studying the open claw architecture, there was a convergence of those two things in my brain where I said, wow, you could use the open claw agent architecture to... In particular, I looked at a TikTok video where a guy explained how you could lower the cost of using AI by using older models that charge less per token to do grunt work, like 

Alan Morgan
Well, 

You
searching 

Alan Morgan
yeah. 

You
the internet. 

Alan Morgan
It's, it's like, you know, instead of buying a $100,000 machine, you, you just, you buy, uh, you buy $5200 machines that are old and you just link them 

You
Right. 

Alan Morgan
together, you know? 

You
So in this case, we would use Google's 1.5 model to do the scraping of the groups that we're targeting, okay? And I mean, really, that is almost free. It's so cheap, it's almost free. And 

Alan Morgan
Yeah. 

You
then when you get a hit. So now you've got a bite, right? We're looking for somebody who's trying to find a good place to care for their schizophrenic, loved one. 

Alan Morgan
Yeah, I mean, you know, a place for a place for, a place for Todd, as opposed to a place for 

You
Okay, 

Alan Morgan
mom. 

You
right. 

Alan Morgan
You know? 

You
And the value of snagging that lead is about 2 grand. I know that for a fact. 

Alan Morgan
Yeah, I mean, that makes, say, guess what, to a psychiatric care center that has, has openings, it's, it's, gotta be worth a lot. 

You
So this is just where my brain went, right? So my brain was, okay, we're going to put these Google ads out into the ether, and we're going to get into the bidding war with Kaiser Permanente, and Eli Lilly, and who else is promoting something for schizophrenia. And maybe we can be competitive at 10 grand a month, and maybe we can't. I don't know yet. It's possible. We'll see. But on the 

Alan Morgan
But 

You
other hand, 

Alan Morgan
you, 

You
Well, 

Alan Morgan
Have to be hugely successful either. 

You
there's that. But on the other hand, why don't I look at special interest groups that populate social media. Facebook has at least 10 schizophrenia groups, and then they are bipolar, and they have schizoaffective. So when you get down to it, there's a million people on Facebook that are in these groups. So it's a subset of Facebook, but it's a nice number, right? And 

Alan Morgan
Right. 

You
we could buy ads in those groups. Or, and this is where the bot came in. I could just look at what people are posting in those groups with a robot. I don't have to sit there and look at it myself all day. and 

Alan Morgan
And have the robot response. 

You
just have the robot response. So the spy, the spy, using a very cheap AI model. The response is crafted using the high tiered, we'll just say the 3.0 Google model that will write a 

Alan Morgan
Well, high quality was 

You
thoughtful 

Alan Morgan
sponsored. 

You
response, right? 

Alan Morgan
Yeah, the personalized, you know, tonal, you know, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's 

You
So 

Alan Morgan
a well crafted ad, so to speak, you know. 

You
it doesn't look like I'm sticking my finger in your eye. 

Alan Morgan
Right, no, it's it's not, yeah, it's not just 

You
And 

Alan Morgan
a. 

You
I tested it. And I tested it, and it tested really well. So, now, I'm in this horrible spot that my brother's been in, where he's constantly scouring the internet to look for data and information about schizophrenia, and it's really... It's like throwing jacks in the air. You don't know where they're going to land on the ground, right? Sometimes they're goods, sometimes they're bad. Sometimes they're easy 

Alan Morgan
Yeah. 

You
to pick up, sometimes you have to reach to pick it up. And then I started looking at the resources where schizophrenic assistance groups live, and it was way more laser focused. It was easy to identify those places. Instead of 1,000, there's 10. And it's easy to keep your eye on those 10 groups and see, as soon as somebody posts, action reaction. And so that was just the genesis of my thought. And I'm really just saying this because I'm recording it, and I want to be able to articulate it back to the AI that's going to help me build it. 

Alan Morgan
I mean, it makes sense. You know, hey, it's part of the journey. I mean, you're, you're looking at one thing and you say, what if, this could be for something, you know, hey, that's, uh, part of, that's invention, right? 

You
I guess it's certainly the way my brain works. I mean, if Tony wanted to advertise his restaurant in Brookfield, you know, he could go to the pioneer press and buy an ad in the local paper, he could put a billboard up on Ogden Avenue. He doesn't have a lot of options. 

Alan Morgan
Right. 

You
But once you involve the internet, now he has a lot of options. 

Alan Morgan
He has a lot of options and, you know, because they have. Some unique qualities, they're open 247, which is, you know, 

You
Yeah, 

Alan Morgan
ah. 

You
that alone is going to attract a certain cab drivers, cops, whatever. 

Alan Morgan
And drivers, caps, people coming after a 

You
Yeah, 

Alan Morgan
show. 

You
hospital workers. There's a lot of people that are attracted to the 24/7 thing. 

Alan Morgan
Well, alone in, you know, that. You know, a 10 mile radius, you know, or well, you know, 

You
Anyway, 

Alan Morgan
20 mile, whatever it is, you know. But 

You
that's 

Alan Morgan
yeah. 

You
the genesis of my thinking. I sent you a crude version of the app that I banged out. 

Alan Morgan
Yeah, I couldn't really get it, uh. Well, I saw something, so. I'll take 

You
Okay. 

Alan Morgan
a look, yeah. 

You
And we'll talk tomorrow. 

Alan Morgan
Now now the only question is, how do we find the people that are willing to pay? 

You
Yeah. 

Alan Morgan
I mean, that, that is, because having, having the, having sliced cheese is only great if you can find the cheese lovers. 

You
Oh, for sure. 

Alan Morgan
You know? They're willing to pay the premium price, because this is a premium product for direct intentional, uh, 

You
Mm-hmm. 

Alan Morgan
ads. It's not, it's not billboard advertising. It's not, uh, uh, you know, it's not regular Facebook advertising or audience, group advertising. This is, you know, directed, intentional 

You
That 

Alan Morgan
responsive. 

You
was my thinking, man. All right. 

Alan Morgan
This is, this is Dyra. Direct. Intentional response 

You
I 

Alan Morgan
and 

You
will talk 

Alan Morgan
resizing. 

You
to you later. Bye. 

Alan Morgan
All right bye.
