The short answer is YES.
We cannot see what random people are typing into Google (that data is locked down), but we can see what Google finds for those searches.
We can turn Google into a "Lead Sensor" by using Google Alerts as a trigger. This is the legitimate, "white-hat" way to monitor the entire web (blogs, forums, news) for your keywords.
Here are the 3 Ways to Hack Google Search for your clients:
1. The "Web Wide" Dragnet (Google Alerts RSS)
 * Best for: Doro Mind (Finding help requests on forums/blogs) & LMAITFY (Tech discussions).
 * How it works: You tell Google, "Anytime you index a new page with these words, tell me immediately."
 * The Hack: Instead of emailing you, we tell Google to output an RSS Feed. We plug that feed into your Gemin-Eye bot (just like we did for Reddit).
The Setup (Do this once):
 * Go to google.com/alerts.
 * Search Query: site:quora.com "schizophrenia help" (or any site you want to watch).
 * Click "Show Options":
   * Deliver to: RSS Feed (This is the secret sauce).
 * Copy that RSS URL.
 * Paste it into your Replit bot.
Result: The moment Google crawls a new forum post asking for help, your bot wakes up and writes a draft response.
2. The "Competitor Poacher" (Google Maps Reviews)
 * Best for: Tony's Pizza.
 * The Concept: The highest-intent lead for a restaurant is someone who just had a bad experience at a competitor.
 * The Trigger: Monitor 1-Star Reviews on rival pizza places in Brookfield.
 * The Bot's Job:
   * Trigger: New 1-star review at "Chain Pizza Place" says: "Pizza was cold and took 2 hours."
   * Bot Action: Alerts you with a draft reply: "Hey [Name], sorry your night was ruined. I'm the owner of Tony's down the street. If you want a fresh pie on the house tonight, DM me."
(Note: You can't reply directly to a competitor's review on Google Maps, but you can find that user on Facebook/Twitter if they use their real name, OR just use this intel to run a "We Deliver Fast" ad targeted at that neighborhood).
3. The "Video Hunter" (YouTube Search)
 * Best for: LMAITFY.ai & Doro Mind.
 * The Concept: YouTube is the 2nd biggest search engine. People search "How to fix my Gmail filters" or "Bipolar symptoms."
 * The Hack: YouTube results also have RSS feeds.
 * The Query: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=[CHANNEL_ID] OR search feeds.
Implementation:
We can add a simple "Google Alert Listener" to your existing Replit code. It uses the exact same logic as the Reddit monitor we just built.
Do you want to add the "Google Alerts RSS" capability to your bot code? (It effectively lets you monitor the entire internet, not just Reddit).
