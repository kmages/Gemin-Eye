Based on the source code you shared, here is exactly how your Gemin-Eye robot functions today, followed by three concrete ways to make it significantly more powerful.
I. How Your "Gemin-Eye" Works Now
Think of your current bot not as a "search engine," but as a "Digital Chief of Staff" sitting in a war room with a dossier of your clients (Tony's, Doro, LMAITFY).
 * The Trigger: You are the scout. You are scrolling Facebook or Reddit and see a post (e.g., "My son is struggling with bipolar"). You copy that text and paste it into Telegram.
 * The War Room (handlePost): The bot instantly pulls the files on all your clients. It looks at their keywords, their "voice" (empathetic vs. snarky), and their offers.
 * The Decision (Gemini 2.5 Flash): The AI acts as a judge. It asks: "Does this post match Tony's? No. Does it match LMAITFY? No. Does it match Doro Mind? YES."
 * The Draft (Gemini 2.5 Pro): Once it picks a winner, it switches to "Copywriter Mode." It writes a reply specifically designed for that client's tone (e.g., "I'm so sorry you're going through this. Have you looked into VR therapy? It helps with triggers...").
 * The Handoff: It hands the finished script back to you. You copy it, switch apps, and post it.
The Verdict: It is a compliant, multi-client, high-accuracy tool. It solves the "blank page problem" (not knowing what to say) and the "compliance problem" (not getting banned).
II. How to Make It Better (3 High-Value Upgrades)
Here are three upgrades we can build into your Replit project to reduce friction and make the bot smarter.
1. The "Vision" Upgrade (Lowest Friction)
The Problem: Copying text from the Facebook mobile app is a nightmare. You have to long-press, select all, copy, switch apps... it takes 10 seconds per lead.
The Fix: Update the bot to accept Screenshots.
 * How it works: You see a lead -> Screenshot it -> Share to Telegram.
 * The Tech: We upgrade server/telegram-bot.ts to send the image directly to Gemini. The AI reads the text from the pixels, identifies the platform (Facebook vs. Reddit), and analyzes the sentiment—all without you typing a word.
 * Why: It turns a 10-second task into a 2-second task. You can process 5x more leads.
2. The "Context" Upgrade (Smarter Replies)
The Problem: The bot sees the text, but it misses the context. A post saying "I need a lawyer" means something very different if it's in a "Divorce Support Group" vs. a "Small Business Owners" group.
The Fix: Make the bot ask for the Group Name (if it can't tell).
 * How it works: If you send a vague post, the bot replies: "I see the post, but which group is this in? (e.g., Chicago Foodies)".
 * The Tech: We tweak the prompt in handlePost to weight the groupName heavily.
 * Why: It prevents embarrassing mismatches (e.g., suggesting a "Divorce Lawyer" to someone asking for a "Patent Lawyer").
3. The "Feedback Loop" (Reinforcement Learning)
The Problem: The bot doesn't know if its replies are good. If it writes a bad draft, you just ignore it, and it never learns.
The Fix: Add "Thumbs Up / Thumbs Down" buttons to every reply.
 * How it works: Under every draft, there are two buttons: [👍 Used It] and [👎 Bad Match].
 * The Tech: If you click "Bad Match," the bot asks "Why?" (e.g., "Too salesy," "Wrong client"). It saves this feedback to the database to adjust future prompts.
 * Why: Your bot gets smarter every single day. After a month, it will know exactly what tone you prefer for Tony's vs. Doro.
Recommendation
I strongly recommend starting with #1 (The Vision Upgrade). It is the single biggest quality-of-life improvement for a mobile workflow.
Would you like me to give you the code block to enable Screenshot Support right now?
